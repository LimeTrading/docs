Async client
==================

Lime client has async support for all methods. Just instantiate `AsyncLimeClient` instead of `LimeClient` and use it
same as you would use `LimeClient`


Instantiate client:

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

    from lime_trader import AsyncLimeClient

    client = AsyncLimeClient.from_file("credentials.json")

Example for getting account balances:

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

    import asyncio
    import pprint

    from lime_trader import AsyncLimeClient


    async def main():
        client = AsyncLimeClient.from_file(file_path="credentials.json")
        balances = await client.account.get_balances()
        pprint.pprint(balances)


    asyncio.run(main())
